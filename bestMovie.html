	<h2 style="color:white;">Why I like the movie</h2>
	<p style="color:red;">This was one of my favorite movies when I was young. I've probably seen this movie 20 times. It's very humorous and also is a very relatable highschool scene. 
	The end is one of my favorite parts too. The bully gets beat up and sent back to live with his parents. It's just a feel good comedy that you want to watch over and over.</p>


	<h2 style="color:white;">My favorite character</h2>
	<p style="color:red;">My favorite charater is this movie is Owen Wilson. He pretends to be a bodyguard for these highschool kids while actually he's a homeless man. He lets his "job" and his homeless life mesh together and it causes problems for the highschool kids. In the movie, Owen Wilson acts like a genuine guy who really just wants to follow his dream of moving to Canada.
