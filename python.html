			<h2>Python Content</h2>
			<h3>Unit 1</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 1 we learned the basics of Python. We experimented with print statements as well as math equations and statements. This Unit was by far the hardest for me because I didn't understand for what reason I was entering each piece of code. It was all foreign to me.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Print Statements – How to set up the code that allows you to print things</p>
			<p>-	Math Equations – How to set up the code for basic math equations</p>
			<p>-	Basic Formatting – Navigate the new program using basic statements</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 2</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 2 we began to start using Pygame. We created a basic player that was controlled by the arrow keys and wasn't allowed to exit the perimeters of the window. We also began integrating class files into our main files. In addition to the class files, we added collide commands. These collide commands allowed us to make it so that objects would not phase through other objects but instead stop.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Class Files – Used separate files to define our variables</p>
			<p>-	Movement – Learned how to integrate controls into our coding</p>
			<p>-	Collide – Kept objects from going through other objects</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 3</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 3 we learned how to effectively use loops. We also learned how to add backgrounds as well as getting objects to spawn at random x and y value based on our perameters. This allowed for the background to be different every time that they game is launched.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Backgrounds – Changed backgrounds</p>
			<p>-	Randomness – Code that made things appear in random spots</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 4</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 4 we learned how to effectively use loops. We created players that had multiple costumes that, when moving a direction, actually looked in that diraction. This allowed us to create much more advanced looking and fuctional games, especially with all the information we know from the previous 3 Units.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Lists – Used lists in costumes</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Final Project</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>For my Final Project I created a maze in which the player had to navigate to the end of 2 levels to win the game. If the player touched any of the walls, the timer would be reset and the player would be sent back to the start. In the second level of the game, I added aliens that moved across the screen that, if touched, would reset the player. The final level also gave the player a shorter amount of time to complete.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Title Screen – Used the spacebar to start the game</p>
			<p>-	Music – Integrated music into the game</p>
