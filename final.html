			<h2>Final Project Content</h2>
			<h3>Stick Figure Solver</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>This project is an extention of my Python Final Project. The requirements were to have 5 levels with at least 5 different class files and 2 uses of a list. My first version of this project had only 2 levels, however I was able to add 3 more levels at a significantly harder difficulty. I ended up getting rid of the timer I had in the original version because it made the game virtually impossible to beat. The mazes themselves were 3 separate uses of very long lists. Experimenting with this project has by far helped me the most in terms of understanding this program. It was fun to create and I really like the game that came out of it.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Use of the code 'random' – I did somewhat know how to use this code before, but the integration of the code in all of the enemy code solidified my understanding</p>
			<p>-	Create mazes – I figures out how to use lists to create a maze</p>
			<p>-	Add music – Learned how to add music into a Python program</p>
			<p>-    Add title screens - Learned how to use a 'while' statement in combination with a picture to create a title screen</p>
