			<h2>Jeroo Content</h2>
			<h3>Unit 1</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 1, we learned the basics of Jeroo. We learned how to command our Jeroos to do simple tasks, usually at the expense of large amounts of unneeded code. We learned how to deal with problems in our code, most of the time because the language was new to us.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Using movement blocks – How to move, How to turn</p>
			<p>-	Creating Jeroos – How to create a Jeroo in the correct orientation</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 2</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Starting in Unit 2, we began to use separate methods in combination with the main method. This allowed for a lot more organized main method, however, underneath was still a lot of unorganized, messy code. We also began coding our Jeroos to interact with their surroundings, whether it be picking a flower or not running into water.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Using methods – How to make separate commands that go into our code</p>
			<p>-	Manipulation of objects – How to pick/plant flowers, break nets, etc.</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 3</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 3, we started to understand the language significantly more. If statements helped us rid of huge amounts of unneeded code. We began to work on much more advanced methods that further increased our knowledge of the language.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	if loops – Using if loops in combination with an object near</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Unit 4</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>In Unit 4, we started solving methods that were purely made from other methods. There was no code telling the Jeroo what to do, instead only telling the Jeroo how to react when presented with specific circumstances. While being much more advanced programming, it also creates a much more diverse code that can be applied to islands other that the one you created it for.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	while loops – Using combinations of if and while loops</p>
			<p></p>
