			<h2>Scratch Content</h2>
			<h3>Name Assignment</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Using event blocks – green flag clicked, when key pressed</p>
			<p>-	Used loops – I used forever block to make a continuous action occur</p>
			<p>-	Movement – I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Computer Buying Project</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Interview someone I know about the computer that they are looking for. The requirements where to have at least 4 different options from which to choose from and explain why I chose the one that I did. We also had to list all of the different components of each of the computers.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Backgrounds – Changed backgrounds as if they were slides</p>
			<p>-	Images – Putting images in Scratch</p>
			<p>-	Movement – Controlling a sprite with the buttons</p>
			<p>-	Variables – Adding variables like slide number</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Final Project</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>Use Scratch to create either a story or game. The story must’ve had at least 3 scenes, at least 3 sprites, at least 8 different think or say boxes, and animated movement.  The game must let the player know if they won, keep score, have a timer, have a help screen, continuously get harder, and stop when over. In addition, both the story and the game must reset and play all the way through when the green flag is clicked.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned:</h4>
			<p>-	Broadcasts – I used broadcasts to link scenes together</p>
			<p>-	Text – I used say boxes to show that the characters were having conversations</p>
